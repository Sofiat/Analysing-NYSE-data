# Analysing-NYSE-data

Drawing from a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies, I used the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

In this project, I calculated the summary statistics, used IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP, then drawing inference from the statistics, I calculated business metrics and used models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies.
